These are some info for our 1st attempt

1: this is a line gotten from a previous sampling made selecting province of Venezia

{"VITTORIO GRAZIANI": {"indirizzo": "SESTIERE CANNAREGIO 2235, 30121, VENEZIA (VE) - (ambulatorio principale)", "comando": "submitLuogo('005513')"}, "MAURIZIO POSENATO": {"indirizzo": "SESTIERE CANNAREGIO 2235, 30121, VENEZIA (VE) - (ambulatorio principale)", "comando": "submitLuogo('005425')"}, "STEFANO GRANZOTTO": {"indirizzo": "SESTIERE CANNAREGIO 2235, 30121, VENEZIA (VE) - (ambulatorio principale)", "comando": "submitLuogo('005824')"}, "AMBRA PANCIERA": {"indirizzo": "SESTIERE CANNAREGIO 575, 30121, VENEZIA (VE) - (ambulatorio secondario)", "comando": "submitLuogo('005975')"}, "STEFANO ZANZOT": {"indirizzo": "SESTIERE SAN POLO 2642, 30125, VENEZIA (VE) - (ambulatorio principale)", "comando": "submitLuogo('006415')"}}


as you can see we've gotten:
last_name first_name, address, main clinic/secondary clinic (*), command(**)

(*) each GP may work jointly with colleagues sharing a common clinic
(**) use for scraping purposes, not meaningful

According this organization, GP's group constitutes an entity

GP's_group (Entity)

id
address
phone number


GP (Entity)

id
belonging_group (if any)
last, first name
time_table (for main)
regional_code (missing at the moment)

Secondary_Clininc (Entity)

id
address
owner_GP
phone_number
time table 

Each GP is labeled with a code (mine os 006760) but I can't say where to retrieve it (sooner or later we'll find this datum)

Each main province's page holds 5 GP's data, except the last one 
We can start by scannig only the province of Venezia. 
Each scan must be archived together with the date of the scan. This registration will allow tracking of the temporal changes that will occur in the list.

Addendum

Types of GPs association:
1) no association (GP alone)  ex: Cristiano Samueli, Fabio Battaggia
2) GP's net: no clinic shared.  It's address is displayed in main clinic panel BUT in panel "Forma associativa" the 3rd column which holds
 main address, various addresses are shown: Examples: Manuele Vianello
3) group of GPs. shared clinic. It's address is displayed in main clinic panel. In this case in panel "Forma associativa" the 3rd column shows 
THE SAME ADDRESS (unfortunately sometimes with minor changes)
4) integrated group. From informatic pow this kind of association does non exhibit any difference form 3. Actually it offers a larger list of
services
